Next version:

Wait for wxWidgets 3.0:
- Update exStat documentation.
- Sorting on listview string column no longer works.
- Make exDir multi threaded.
- Use new wxAuiToolBar.
- New wxSTC has a fix in GetTextRaw, maybe this fixed some things for exSTC.
- exFile::Read is much slower than v1.12 (see sample). Maybe set USE_STL helps?
- Add WXDLLEXPORT.
- Add SpinCtrlDouble to exConfigDialog (in new SVN).
- No longer use iterate on strings by index, but use iterators instead.
  See in stc.cpp::SequenceDialog
  for (int pos = end.length() - 1; pos >= 0; pos--)
  {
    lines *= abs(end[pos] - start[pos]) + 1;
  }
  And in textfile.cpp::ParseLine.
  wxString s = "hello";
  wxString::iterator i;
  for (i = s.begin(); i != s.end(); ++i)
  {
    wxUniChar uni_ch = *i;
    wxChar ch = uni_ch;
     // same as wxChar ch  = *i;
  }
- Find in Grid and SetGridCursor does not work?
- Print All (i.e. exSTC Print(false)) does not work, same problem as with IP Gateway (when prompt false, nothing is printed).
  Then the lib can be used for building a spooler as well.
- Print prints empty page.
  Maybe:
  In exPrintout check on page.x == 0 etc. and the 0.8 factor should be as in Code::Blocks.
  Done, no change, also Print Preview missing lines.
- Copy/paste between msw exSTC and gtk exSTC is not possible. There was a change in wxWidgets 2.9.

- In exSTC you cannot place the cursor inside the () pair for cpp lexer (bug in Scintilla?).
- In exNotebook add a SyncCloseAll for close complete notebook (if the event can be catched).
- In exFileName the IsLink does not seem to work:
  when adding links to a project, the link text is not coloured.
- In exGrid add rules for html tables (not yet implemented in html/m_tables.cpp 'The tables handler:').
- Improve embedded html lexers, like Scite does (wait for next scintilla version??).
  And check the scite sources how.

Roadmap:
- Convert lexers.cfg into xml format.
- Making the find/replace dialog a static member of exInterface does not work for Linux.
  Test again in 2.1.
- When opening large file, allow open to be cancelled, and show progress.
  Maybe use a separate thread for this.
- Add dialog for updating the include directory (with browsing for folders).

     In exSTC when document is changed, uses event wxEVT_STC_MODIFIED in OnStyledText
     for displaying new modification time and call PropertiesMessage.
     If file is synchronized, while there was a selection,
     the selection is gone, whereas ADDTEXT should not change the selection.

     all db code in exTextFile is removed.

wxWidgets-SVN (scintilla 1.75)

<tr>
<td>
v1.12
<td>
26 October 2007
<td>
<ul>
<li> Replace in files is fixed.
<li> In exConfigDialog checkboxes no longer grow.
<li> Fix in lexers, so in lexers.cfg /* */ can be used too for comments, and can be folded.
<li> wxTextFile::GetEOL instead of constant cEOL.
<li> Fix for exSTC Save As, now also updates lexer.
<li> Change all ID_ALL into ID_STC_ALL.
</ul>
<td>
wxWidgets 2.8.6 (scintilla 1.70)

<tr>
<td>
v1.11
<td>
17 September 2007
<td>
<ul>
<li> The lexers file parses as a cpp file, so #RRGGBB colours are
     interpreted correctly.
<li> Added allow sync so you can set sync behaviour.
<li> Moved exNotebook from base to it's own files.
<li> In exSTC::FileSave if filename is empty, do a FileSaveAs.
<li> GotoLine selects the line if text empty.
<li> Text raw added.
<li> Paste was enabled, but pasting did not put any characters.
</ul>
<td>
wxWidgets 2.8.5 (scintilla 1.70)

<tr>
<td>
v1.10
<td>
30 August 2007
<td>
<ul>
<li> Updated extension.h, only often used files are included, split of large files.
<li> Added grid rendering.
<li> In exSTC links inside ' and ' are allowed too.
<li> Fix in exLexer.
</ul>
<td>
wxWidgets 2.8.4 (scintilla 1.70)

<tr>
<td>
v1.9
<td>
16 August 2007
<td>
<ul>
<li> In exSTC and AddAsciiTable do not use %3d, that fills using spaces. Just set tab size temporary.
     Also, settings as Show Eol char should not be used for the ascii table.
<li> Several keywords are allowed on one line in lexers.cfg.
<li> Hex mode is improved (opening twice as fast).
     In hex mode, if cursor on a char, colour the corresponding char on the other field.
<li> In exListView wxGTK Sort By Date gives error Date Format,
     this causes Project Sync not to work on gtk as well.
<li> Small improvement in exConfigDialog.
</ul>

<tr>

v1.8
<td>
9 July 2007
<td>
<ul>

<li> In exSTC hex view when on 0x00010 and doing ctrl d, no tooltip appears.
<li> In exSTC::SetLexer if (m_Lexer.GetScintillaLexer().empty()) return false;
     results in global styles not applied, as that is done later on in Colourise.
<li> In exStatusText added a flag DEFAULT, and use that in syncedit support instead of 0.
<li> In exLexers change name GetFileName into GetFullPath.
<li> exSTCEntryDialog supports binary data containing NULL.
<li> Syncing is improved, also on file size change, and better honouring the selection
     (using Append, so now done by Scintilla, though it seems not correct always).
</ul>

<li> In exSTC add link popup menu not if menu type = EX_STC_SIMPLE (for socket server).
