Wait for wxWidgets 3.0:
- Sorting on listview string column no longer works.
- Make exDir multi threaded.
- Use new wxAuiToolBar.
- New wxSTC has a fix in GetTextRaw, maybe this fixed some things for exSTC.
- exFile::Read is much slower than v1.12 (see sample). Maybe set USE_STL helps?
- Add WXDLLEXPORT.
- Add SpinCtrlDouble to exConfigDialog (in new SVN).
- No longer use iterate on strings by index, but use iterators instead.
  See in stc.cpp::SequenceDialog
  for (int pos = end.length() - 1; pos >= 0; pos--)
  {
    lines *= abs(end[pos] - start[pos]) + 1;
  }
  And in textfile.cpp::ParseLine.
  wxString s = "hello";
  wxString::iterator i;
  for (i = s.begin(); i != s.end(); ++i)
  {
    wxUniChar uni_ch = *i;
    wxChar ch = uni_ch;
     // same as wxChar ch  = *i;
  }
- Find in Grid and SetGridCursor does not work?
- Print All (i.e. exSTC Print(false)) does not work, same problem as with IP Gateway (when prompt false, nothing is printed).
  Then the lib can be used for building a spooler as well.
- Print prints empty page.
  Maybe:
  In exPrintout check on page.x == 0 etc. and the 0.8 factor should be as in Code::Blocks.
  Done, no change, also Print Preview missing lines.
- Copy/paste between msw exSTC and gtk exSTC is not possible. There was a change in wxWidgets 2.9.

- In exSTC you cannot place the cursor inside the () pair for cpp lexer (bug in Scintilla?).
- In exNotebook add a SyncCloseAll for close complete notebook (if the event can be catched).
- In exFileName the IsLink does not seem to work:
  when adding links to a project, the link text is not coloured.
- In exGrid add rules for html tables (not yet implemented in html/m_tables.cpp 'The tables handler:').
- Improve embedded html lexers, like Scite does (wait for next scintilla version??).
  And check the scite sources how.

Roadmap:
- Added platform switches to lexers.xml.
- Making the find/replace dialog a static member of exInterface does not work for Linux.
  Test again in 1.1.
- When opening large file, allow open to be cancelled, and show progress.
  Maybe use a separate thread for this.
- Add dialog for updating the include directory (with browsing for folders).
