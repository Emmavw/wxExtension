<p>
wxfiletool contains a collection of wxextension classes
that are implemented for a list view component.

<!--
Wait for next wxWidgets:
- In Process::HasInput allow php script error messages to be able to be double clicked and goto line no.
  Is already added, but the reg ex does not match, wait for next wxWidgets.
  Then also change the gcc check implemented by tokenizer into reg ex check.
- wxGTK find in files is slow. It seems exDir is okay, but time consuming is adding the
  found files as items to the list view, whereas that could be fast. Profiling necessary??
  Or just hope better for next wxWidgets.

Roadmap:
- In STC adding file drop causes text dragging not work.
  In scintilla v1.70 file drop is supported (how?), check and remove from here if okay.
  This can be tested in sample for wxextension.
- Make process and wxGTK can be improved: not always a valid file is found.
  And for each new Run clear the old contents??
