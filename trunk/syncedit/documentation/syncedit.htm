<P>
syncedit is a synchronizing editor, with automatic synchronizing for all its
<A HREF="#EDIT">Editor windows</A> and its <A HREF="#LIST">List windows</A>.
Furthermore it supports <A HREF="#SQL">embedded SQL</A> and it works with 
<A HREF="#SVN">SVN</A>.
Finally you can download selected files easily using
<A HREF="#UPL">Build RBS File</A>.
Because the lists and editors are notebook pages, they all can be moved around and
put on separate panes.

<P>
The configuration is read when starting up and saved when closing down.
On MSW the config is stored in the registry under the key
"syncedit", on Linux in the file ".syncedit" in your home
directory. There is also a special portable version (syncped) that stores and 
reads all data from the same directory as your executable is in.

<P>
You can specify on the command line the file(s) or project to open.

<P>
You can also select and run a process using Process Select and Process Run.
The output (stdout and stderr) of the process is logged into the output
list 'Process Output'.

<A NAME="EDIT"></A><B>Editor</B>
<P>
This is an MDI notebook editor implemented using a
<A HREF="http://www.scintilla.org">scintilla</A> component.
It has the next features:
<ul>
<li> Synchronizes if the file is changed from outside. Can be used for
     viewing log files: If you're on the last position in a log file
     and the log file is synchronized, then only new data is added to the
     file, and your position is restored to the end of file. This also works in hex mode
     (enabled/disabled by toggling the Hex button).
<li> The lexer, colouring and keywords are from lexers.xml, editable using 'Lexers File Open'.
     This directly reflects
     colouring style changes on all open editors.
<li> Fast searching by selecting text and pressing F3 or F4.
     Expressions are interpreted as regular expressions if the
     'Match whole word' check box is not checked.
<li> If you select several lines, you can sort the selection using
     any sort position in the selection. The default sort position
     is the cursor position at the last line of the selection.
<li> You can set the position of the edge column.
     This position is also used when adding check-in or out comments.
<li> You can set rectangular selection by pressing ALT before selecting.
<li> When the mouse is on a hex number the decimal number is
     shown as a tooltip py pressing Ctrl T.
<li> Links are navigated using popup menu on a Link.
</ul>

<hr>
<A NAME="LIST"></A><B>List</B>
<P>
The output lists and the projects are implemented using a MDI notebook using a
standard list control component.

<P>
It has the next features:

<ul>
<li> Synchronizes if a list item is changed from outside.
<li> Items (the background colour of items) are coloured according to their
modification time. This colour can be set using Set Colour.
<li> Columns<br>
All lists have at least the following columns:
<ul>
<li> Name
<li> Type<br>
For folders this field holds the pattern that was specified during Adding the folder.
<li> Modified<br>
<li> In Folder
<li> Size<br>
For folders this field is not used.
</ul>
<li> 'Find In ...' is available that allows you
to find text in all files in your project. If items are selected in
the project, then searching is limited to these files.
<li> The list can be sorted on each of its columns by
clicking on the column header.
You also have an Automatic Sort option for the project. If set, then
your project is automatically sorted ascending or descending
(depending on your SortMethod) and resorted whenever
one of the files in the project is synchronized.
<li> An item on the list can be opened by double clicking.
<li> List items can be copied to the clipboard as
ascii text with columns separated by tabs, and then pasted on other lists,
or into an edit window.
<li> You can compare items with each other, or with a base version from
a version list. A version list can be created from an item if the item
is part of a directory structure where the same item appears in
another directory as well where that directory matches the [0-9]*\\.[0-9]*.*" regular expression.
</ul>

<P>
The project file is stored as a text file containing the full paths of all items,
you can edit it using 'File Open As Text' in order to replace or change items.
The file format is: ['fullpath'[\t'folder extension']\n]+.

<P>
File attributes like modification times and access rights are not stored in this file,
they are read from disk each time you open the file.


<hr>
<A NAME="SQL"></A><B>Embedded SQL Queries</B>
<P>
Some applications contain a lot of tables, but cannot access a database
where these tables better would be stored.
Therefore Embedded SQL support has been
added to syncedit. It is implemented by allowing you to put standard ANSI SQL queries as
comments (according to a special syntax described below) for your source code
language before data you like to be get from the ODBC database. When syncedit detects such
a query, it will run it and put the new results directly after the query replacing all
that is there until the end of SQL comment statement is found.

<P>
'Run SQL Query' allows you to run the embedded SQL queries.
The files selected should have a checked out status.
You now select an ODBC database, and the files that contain embedded queries are updated with the new
values from the database.

<P>
The syntax is:

<P>
<small><I>CommentStart</small></I>_SQL_#
<small><I>YourQuery</small></I> #
<small><I>QueryInfo</small></I>
<small><I>CommentEnd</small></I>
<small><I>Data</small></I>
<small><I>CommentStart</small></I>_SQL_END <small><I>CommentEnd</small></I>,
<P>

<P>
where:
<BR>
<small><I>CommentStart</small></I> form the control characters to indicate that
the following text should be interpreted as legal comments for the specific source language,<BR>
<small><I>_</small></I> is exactly one space character,<BR>
<small><I>CommentEnd</small></I> form the control characters to indicate that here the
comments end for the specific source language,<BR>
<small><I>YourQuery</small></I> is the SQL query you want to perform,<BR>
<small><I>QueryInfo</small></I> is information about the query generated by syncedit,<BR>
<small><I>Data</small></I> is the new data that is the result of the query.

<P>
E.g. an embedded query in PDP-11 assembler:

<A NAME="SVN"></A><B>SVN</B>
<P>
This handles local revision.
TODO: svn explain.
A file that is checked in will have its Windows or UNIX read-only attribute set.

<P>
When checking in you can
add comments to the file(s) being checked in. The check-in comment is placed in
the source file
directly after the first empty line that is found, and always consists of the
time and date the check-in is
made (the format used is explained below), followed by the RCS/User option,
followed by the entered comment.
The check-in comment is always split up into lines containing 'Edit/EdgeColumn' characters.
syncedit
takes care that no words are split over two lines if the entered comment exceeds
this amount of characters.

<P>
Supported revision time formats:

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1 class="TableStyle">

<TR><TD> <I>Format</I><TD> <I>Example</I>
<tr><td>%2y%2m%2d %2H%2M%2S<td>990826 152624
<tr><td>%2y%2m%2d<td>990826
<tr><td>%B %d, %Y %H:%M<td>January 12, 2001 12:32
</TABLE>

<P>
E.g. a check-in comment that is placed into a PDP-11 Assembler file:

<P>
<PRE>
;*********************************************************************
; MODULE NAME  : TPHONY
; FILE NAME    : FSMLRP.MAC
; DATE         : 04-MARS-89
; FUNCTION     : FSM-DATA FOR LRP AND TEMPORARY TABLES
;*********************************************************************

; 990826 152311 AvW Added defaults to the table by using SQL connect.
</PRE>

<P>
E.g. a check-in comment that is placed into a PASCAL file:

<P>
<PRE>
(****************************************************************************
** MODULE NAME       : STATIS
** FILE NAME         : STAPRITB.PAS

<A NAME="UPL"></A><B>Build RBS File</B>
<P>
syncedit uses a Reflection Basic script file for Kermit to allow uploading (the Windows version only).

<P>
The "Build RBS File" command creates the Reflection Basic
Script file based on the items you selected, and allows you to replace a part of the folder name
(e.g. substitute 'F:\GAREX\V807\' with ''). This simplifies downloading updated files back to
a remote system.
Using Run Script in Reflection Basic allows you to run this script file, now all files are sent using
Kermit to that system.
</P>

<P>
syncedit assumes RSX OS on the remote system.
