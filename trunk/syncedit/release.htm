</title>
</head>

<!---
Next version:
- Searching for text in the toolbar combo box by pressing enter causes same text to be entered.
- Find In Project text: 'split' does not work, 'SPLIT' does, though no case.
- In Bewerken Extra Header: niet vertaald, en HANGT!
- Find and replace dialog no longer works!!!
- Solve \todo.

Wait for next wxWidgets:
- Use wxDataViewSortedListModel for lists instead of ftListView (but sample dataview not in wxGTK-2.8.0).
- Maximize window search results is not correct.
- Relation with SyncCloseAll and exNotebook (wait for update in wxAuiNotebook).

Roadmap:
- Add ctags (like Exuberant CTAGS).
- Add gdb front-end.
- Use Boost, Ultimate++ or OMGUI (very later).

<hr>
<A NAME="33"></A><B>Version 3.3</B>
<P><I>Released: 30-11-2001</I>
<P>
Uses wxTextFile. This is a better base class since it already contains functions
such as DetermineFileType. StrStream is no longer necessary.
Command line interface support.
<ol>
<li> Removed threads. The threads did not work okay under Linux, and under Windows 2000
     there were problems as well. This makes the application simpler and smaller.
<li> Visual C++ Compiler now uses no exception support (52k less code). Setting Single Threaded Library gives
     4 linking errors buffer::openprot?
<li> Most code is converted to Unicode, using wxT() macro over all text, and using wxChar instead of char.
<li> The Linux version did not handle SetReadOnlyAccess okay, read bit was not set if read-only.
<li> The Author field is no longer used to end a Header Description. Instead
     any other field, or an empty field is used to end the description.
<li> CompareSetup has been improved: comparing now uses Upper and checks mtimes, so Compare
     Recent Version really finds different versions. It can now be stopped too.
<li> Count and Report Count show the summary in a new text window part of the Count notebook page.
     This allows you to copy counted numbers more easily.
     If counted and 1 element selected, the name of this element is logged.
     Show does not Log if number of completed files is zero.
<li> AddDialog has extra checkbox for IncludeParentOnly. Add New File no longer uses the dialog,
     and gives as default path the current project. Tooltips added, and from folder now starts
     in current project.
<li> If an SQL query returns an error, the sqllog file is opened automatically. Read-only files are no
     longer executed. The database is closed before running.
<li> Added time stamp to log window.
<li> The wxHtmlWindow is no longer used for help contents. Instead just invokes MIME on .htm.
     This gives an executable almost 100k size less.
<li> OnIdle has been improved: added RequestMore() and indeed external changes are updated a lot faster.
<li> Data Mining has been removed.
<li> The wxGTK version no longer has out commented database code. so wxUSE_ODBC should be set in the
     setup.h file. ./configure --with-odbc works okay.
<li> RBS* only available for wxMSW (and Build RBS File option).
     RBSDefaultFolder and RBSMakefile now available for both RSX and VMS.
<li> Added windows place, size, style and sash position at startup and close down.
<li> SetProject is improved, now source code files and folders determine project.
<li> The Edit Create Comment shows the language description in the title.

<li> During FileOpen Hide and Show is used this speeds up processing, especially for Linux.
<li> Menu accelerators have been added.
<li> FTP support has been added.
</ol>

<P>Bugs</P>
<ol>
<li> The comment: "/* comment */// other comment" is not counted correctly
     (as in all previous versions).
</ol>

<hr>
<A NAME="32"></A><B>Version 3.2</B>
<P><I>Released: 11-07-2001</I>
<P>
Changed config into a property sheet to get the Options Edit back again.
<ol>
<li> Adding sub folders on parent level only is now possible using key IncludeParentOnly.
<li> RBSStream has been improved: no hard coded strings for the VAX, everything settable in config.
<li> All key values are written to the registry only when exiting (no more ReadWrite).
<li> Added html help contents and updated the .htm file.
<li> Added key DefaultFolder for opening and saving files.
</ol>

<hr>
<A NAME="31"></A><B>Version 3.1</B>
<P><I>Released: 22-06-2001</I>
<P>
Uses wxWidgets 2.2.7. Improved sorting for strings, now exactly sorted.
<ol>
<li> Column percentage is no longer used.
<li> First default revision in a header starts at 1.1, instead of 1.0.
</ol>

<hr>
<A NAME="30"></A><B>Version 3.0</B>
<P><I>Released: 12-06-2001</I>
<P>
Uses wxWidgets 2.2.1. Dialogs are designed using wxDesigner 2.5.
Application is now available for Unix (Linux RedHat 6.2) as well.
Reason for changing to wxWidgets has been as test case for developing MEWINT using wxWidgets.
Threads are back again.
<ol>
<li> Embedded SQL support is now for any ODBC database, not only Access.
     This caused a small change in queries supported: columns are now separated by ' instead of " sign, and
     the ''' used to generate a ' sign is now a CHR(39). Error reporting when queries have incorrect syntax
     is improved (a detailed sqllog.txt file is available). SQL statements supported is no longer
     limited to SELECT queries, now DROP TABLE statements etc. are supported as well.
<li> The main frame is a splitter window with a notebook containing several pages
     with image index for reports.
<li> EditDialog is improved, now uses a wxGrid for displaying counts, numbers are right aligned.
<li> MRU support has been added to the File menu.
<li> Compare Recent Version has been added, this directly compares the selected item with the most recent item found.
<li> Compare and Restore dialog are combined into a Version List, EditDeleteDoubles is invoked automatically,
     so only real different versions appear in this window.
<li> List timer support is now replaced by OnIdle support in the list class,
     synchronization no longer activated for folders.
     The OnIdle is better, since it is called when application is idle.
<li> All ClassBuilder _ref members are replaced by the Get.. methods.
<li> All exceptions are removed.
<li> Options is removed from the menu.
<li> The config is much simpler, templates are no longer used.
<li> GetNextRevisionNumber contained error for revisions above 2 digits, was incorrect spaced.
<li> Copy Elements and Sub Elements now both copy elements separated by newlines to the clipboard.
<li> SetProject is improved, now only source code files determine project.
<li> Backup support is removed.
<li> Headers added have RCS keywords.
<li> Tool tips are now available for the tool bar.
<li> All icons (except application icon) have been replaced by bitmaps, so now same code for Linux and MSW.
<li> At startup the week number and the day of the week are logged.
<li> Data Mining has been out commented.
<li> xv is used for translating bmp into xpm files for Linux.
</ol>

<hr>
<A NAME="22"></A><B>Version 2.2</B>
<P><I>Released: 18-12-2000</I>
<P>
Uses the XTToolKit library XT122DemoLib, this is the successor for the CodeJock library.
However it is no longer freeware.
<ol>
<li> Support for more RCS Keywords has been added, and is now conform RCS rules.
<li> Engine and Interface classes are separated.
<li> ReportSQL did not report file names ok in the previous version.
<li> Drag/drop support has been added.
<li> Revision Number is now shown (if present) with RevisionEdit.
<li> The CompareWithBase from config is removed, automatically done when Comparing on 1 file.
</ol>

<hr>
<A NAME="21"></A><B>Version 2.1</B>
<P><I>Released: 14-11-2000</I>
<P>
Uses the CodeJock Library v6.09 that offers sorting, and provides a flat header with a sorting image,
and some file name classes (CCJShell).
<ol>
<li> The revision number is shown and updated as well. RevisionEdit was not invoked for revisions consisting
     of only 1 revision in the header. Revisions are now reported if found in the entire source file,
     not only before fist 3 lines of code, and the version numbers are added after parsing is complete,
     no longer after first empty line.
<li> All status bar pane 0 text is displayed in an edit box, and written to a log file as well, all status
     bars share one log file. This is for project management. The log file can be
     opened directly under File Open Logfile.
<li> The project file format has changed, item data, images, states (including mod. times), are no longer stored.
     Counts are now part of new report count, therefore not stored either.
     New file format: ['fullpath'[\t'folder extension']\n]+.
<li> The mining database has been extended with two tables for project management. These tables are updated
     each time Continue is invoked, the config now contains a MiningDatabase member which allows the mining
     database to be opened automatically when starting up.
<li> Non source files are opened using the registry. Images are improved, and image lists are now shared by
     all lists. Now regular shell images are used for non-source code files. The folder image is no longer used,
     as it is taken from the system list.
<li> Support for the Unix 'static char ident' has been improved. The previous version did not update it
     when making new revisions. This version just updates any idents found and the correct assist type was selected.
