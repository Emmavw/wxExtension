Software Development Plan


General

- storage is on sliksvn

- development is in svn trunk, under windows TortoiseSVN is used,
    under Linux just the svn client

- GUI library wxWidgets, currently svn (as there is not yet a base)

- database is OTL

- stable releases are in tags/branches

- application icons are designed using GIMP
    but menu and toolbar bitmaps are from wxWidgets, using wxArtProvider,
    or gtk stock items

- most documentation is generated using Doxygen
    however, some docs are in html format

- automated testing is done using cppunit

- translation is done using poedit


Adding functionality in trunk

- add a sample for it in
    extension/sample, 
    filetool/sample, 

- add a test for it in 
    extension/test/base, 
    extension/test/app, 
    filetool/test, 
  where it has least dependancies
