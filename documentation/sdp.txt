Software Development Plan


General

- Subversion Repository is on xp-dev.com, 
    http://svn.xp-dev.com/svn/antonvw-wxprojects/
    https://svn.xp-dev.com/svn/antonvw-wxprojects/

- Subversion access
    under windows TortoiseSVN is used,
    under Linux just the svn client

- GUI library wxWidgets, currently svn (as there is not yet a base)
    http://wxwidgets.org/

- development 
  under windows using Mingw and codeblocks: 
  http://www.codeblocks.org/
  under using linux gcc and no IDE

- database is OTL
    http://otl.sourceforge.net/

- application icons are designed using GIMP
    but menu and toolbar bitmaps are from wxWidgets, using wxArtProvider,
    or gtk stock items

- most documentation is generated using Doxygen
    however, some docs are in html format
    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

- automated testing is done using cppunit
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit

- translation is done using poedit
    http://www.poedit.net/


SVN hierarchy

- development is in svn trunk, 

- stable releases are in tags/branches

- documentation contains all general docs


When adding functionality in trunk

- add a test for it in 
    extension/test/base, 
    extension/test/app, 
    filetool/test, 
  where it has least dependancies

- add a sample for it in
    extension/sample, 
    filetool/sample,
