# This bash script regenerates the HTML doxygen version of the
# wxWidgets manual and adjusts the doxygen log to make it more
# readable.
#
# Usage:
#    ./regen.sh [html|chm|xml|latex|all]
#
# Pass "x" to regen only the X output format and "all" to regen them all.
# If no arguments are passed all formats are regenerated
# (just like passing "all").
#


# remember current folder and then cd to the docs/doxygen one
me=$(basename $0)
path=${0%%/$me}        # path from which the script has been launched
current=$(pwd)
cd $path
export WXWIDGETS=`pwd`

#
# NOW RUN DOXYGEN
#
# NB: we do this _after_ copying the required files to the output folders
#     otherwise when generating the CHM file with Doxygen, those files are
#     not included!
#
doxygen

# return to the original folder from which this script was launched
cd $current
